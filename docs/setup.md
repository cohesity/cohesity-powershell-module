# Setup

## Steps to install

### Online installation
You can install Cohesity PowerShell Module directly using the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=cohesity).

  > **Tip:** Please follow the steps based on the flavor of PowerShell that you are running.
  * If installing on `MacOS` and `Linux` you must use the steps for `PowerShell Core`.
  * If installing on `Windows` you should use the steps for `Windows PowerShell`, unless you are running `PowerShell Core`.
  **NOTE:** Windows with powershell version 7 or higher requires `Cohesity.Powershell.core`.

#### ** PowerShell Core **

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name Cohesity.PowerShell.Core
  ```

#### ** Windows PowerShell **

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name Cohesity.PowerShell
  ```

<!-- tabs:end -->

  If you are running PowerShell as a user without elevated privileges (non-admin user), you may need to add `-Scope CurrentUser` to these commands. In some cases, you may also need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` to set the execution policy that allows import of the module.

* Copy over this zip file to the target machine
* Unzip the contents of the zip file to one of the directory paths mentioned in the output of `$env:PSModulePath` on the target machine.
